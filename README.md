# active_directory.py
See if a user exists in a group. A group may contain one or more group(s). For my test cases, I created the following directory structure.
		        parent (grp)
          		      |
			child_a (grp)  child_b (grp)
			   |               |
          subchlld_1 (grp)  subchild_2 (grp)
               |    |                 |
sub_child_user_a sub_child_user_b  sub_child_user_c

Time complexity: TBD - Time complexity for recursion has not explained. 

Space Complexity: TBD - Space complexity has not been explained.
